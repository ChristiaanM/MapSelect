# Map Select

Author(s): Christiaan Johann MÃ¼ller

Map select is a library that implements different map point selection approaches for selecting map points generated by sparse visual simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. This first public release is limited to maps stored by a modified version of ORB-SLAM 2 for testing maps offline (modified: https://github.com/ChristiaanM/ORB_SLAM2_Selection) and contains the approaches described in "Map Point Selection for Visual SLAM".[^fn] Some sample maps are included here [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19SB5JmQW0m7A04oRNNT6iSZVBC0IXwKQ?usp=drive_link).

## Roadmap 

<ul>
<li>  <s>Initial Documentation</s> </li>
<li> Release Online Selection
<li> Reduce Dependancies (GTSAM / OpenCV/ OSMap) </li>
<li> Add experimental features to the public release </li>
</ul>
    
## License

Distributed under the GPLv3 License. See `LICENSE` for more information.
## Dependancies

Eigen3 (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/i)
 
Protobuf (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)

GTSAM (https://github.com/borglab/gtsam)

OpenCV (https://opencv.org/)

## Optional Dependancies
These dependencies are optional and CMAKE should detect their presence and disable relevant features if they are not available.

CHOLMOD is included in SuiteSparse (https://github.com/DrTimothyAldenDavis/SuiteSparse)

GUROBI https://www.gurobi.com/
Used for optimising integer programming models. 

## Build Instructions

Install the previously mentioned Dependancies. 

run the "build.sh" script in the root directory

## Common Problems

Having multiple versions of protocal buffers can cause issues with linking at runtime. If you are on a linux based machine, be sure to check that 
protoc --version is the same version than what is linked as compilation time.
